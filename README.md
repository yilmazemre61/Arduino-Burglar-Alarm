# Arduino-Burglar-Alarm
The project is an approach to a burglar alarm. If you enter the house and don't enter the password to inactivate the alarm in given time, the alarm will go off.
While alarm is off you have a chance to stop it if you know the second password. You enter the password and the alarm will stop.
